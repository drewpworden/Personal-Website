          Welcome to the portfolio of all the work I did as an RA during the 2019-2020 academic year at Western Connecticut State University.
          This portfolio is broken up into five sections, <a  class = "top_links" href="#cover_title">cover letter</a>, <a class = "top_links" href = "#resume_title">resume</a>, <a class = "top_links" href = "#door_tag_title">door tags</a>, bulletin boards, and programs.

            This was my first door tag, so they were put up in the hall before I could get input on what residents were interested in.
            They were a little generic but they seemed to be accepted and enjoyed. Residents that have moved rooms over the academic year
            have taken them as they moved to other parts of the building and now live on their new doors. I take this as a sign that they liked them.
          </p>

          <p class = "door_text">
              I got the idea for this door tag while doing HFS inspections. A few of my residents had soduko and crossword puzzles laying out on their
              desks, so I decided to theme my board and door tags off of that. They where well recieved and a few residents liked them so much that they took the effort to knock on
              my door and tell me.
          </p>
          <div class = "door_bar"></div>
          <h5 id = "door_num1" class = "door_number">#3</h5>
          <img id = "door3" src = "../../resources/images/ra_port_1920/door3.png" alt = "google maps door tag">
          <p class = "door_text">
              This door tag was meant to be similar in theme to the bulletin board for the month. The board was a world map with pointers where residents could take
              a pointer and point to a location they wanted to visit around the world. The logo for Google Maps seemed appropriate.
          </p>
          <div class = "door_bar"></div>
          <h5 id = "door_num1" class = "door_number">#4</h5>
          <img id = "door4" src = "../../resources/images/ra_port_1920/door4.jpg" alt = "qr code door tag">
          <p class = "door_text">
              This is the door tag that I and my residents liked the best. I wanted a Matrix-esque theme to the month's board and door tags and I decided to approach it
              through QR codes. Each individual resident had a different QR code that, when scanned, would display there name.
          </p>
          <div class = "door_bar"></div>
          <h5 id = "door_num5" class = "door_number">#5</h5>
          <img id = "door4" src = "../../resources/images/ra_port_1920/door5.jpg" alt = "bowtie door tag">
          <p id = "door_text_5" class = "door_text">
              As is a common trend among all my door tags, this door tag was meant to be thematically similar to my current bulletin board on resumes and
              resume building. The bulletin board had a siloutte of a suit jacket and a tie, so the bow-tie door tags tied the hall together nicely.
