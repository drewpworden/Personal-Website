          Welcome to my portfolio of all the work I did as an RA during the 2019-2020 academic year at Western Connecticut State University.
          This portfolio is broken up into four sections, resume, cover letter, <a href = "#door_tag_title">door tags</a>, and bullitin boards.
        </p>
        <div class = "door_tags">

            This was my first door tag, so they were put up in the hall before I could get input on what residents were interested in.
            They were a little generic but they seemed to be accepted and enjoyed. Residents that have moved rooms over the academic year
            have taken them as they moved to other parts of the building and now live on their new doors. I take this as a sign that they liked them.

              I got the idea for this door tag while doing HFS inspections. A few of my residents had soduko and crossword puzzles.
